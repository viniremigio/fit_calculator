# Fit Calculator

A gist of how you can calculate the amount of calories per day you should eat in order to **gain**, 
**lose** or **maintain** your weight!

## How to run

```
python -m fitapp <weight> <height> <age> <goal: lose|gain>
```

## TODO
- Save locally metrics **[OK]**
- Apply a weight estimation
- Docker Container
- Unit tests support **[OK]**
